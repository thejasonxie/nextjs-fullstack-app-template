# Next.js Fullstack Application Template

This is a scalable architecture template for buildling a fullstack app in Next.js. Technologies included in the template are:

- Next.js (React, ESLint)
- Prettier
- Husky
- VSCode configurations (settings and debugging)
- CommitLint
- CrossEnv
- Storybook

This was created by following [How to Build Scalable Architecture for your Next.js Project](https://dev.to/alexeagleson/how-to-build-scalable-architecture-for-your-nextjs-project-2pb7#vs-code-configuration) by [Alex Eagleson](https://dev.to/alexeagleson). I disabled yarn usage and forced npm instead.
